Numerical World Color Survey with human JNDs: weakness of the bias. The histogram of the squared distance d = ∑14 i=1(xi − xi) 2 between the position of the i-th centroid and its average (“typical”) value. Black data represent the statistics of those populations displaying 14 linguistic categories at the end of Category Game simulations with the human JND, which were roughly ∼ 1300 of the total 5000 considered populations. The inset displays the actual values of d for each population. Green and red data come from a “Random” model where each “language” is produced by a uniform random distribution of 14 category centroids. A random case with a very large number of languages (red curve) represents the “ideal” statistics of such a model. The distances d from the average pattern (shown in the inset) appear to have a larger average drand than the Category Game model dCG (where by d we refer to the mean value of the random and the CG cases, respectively), but since we are interested in the fluctuations we have rescaled the random model data, dividing them by drand/dCG, in order to compare the histograms. A power law fit ∼ x−3 is also shown as a guide for the eye.;Which of the following lines represent a random model with 1300 languages?;A;B;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.9975547790527344;0.9975547790527344;0.9975547790527344;A;B;False;False;True;True;False
