The caption is: 'Figure 2. Example distributions of distances between non-related pairs (light grey) and related pairs (dark grey) on Twitter data, using a simple mean of word embeddings.'.
Question: What is the label of the y axis?
[Data-only cue] Focus your response more on numeric or textual values.
Use information from the caption when it directly supports your answer; otherwise, focus on data present in the visual itself.
Respond with a concise, one-word or very short phrase. No full sentences, no explanations.
If the response is numeric, use digits only and include any units or suffixes (e.g., %, kg, $).
If the answer cannot be inferred from the figure and caption, please reply with the sentence: 'It is not possible to answer this question based only on the provided data.'
