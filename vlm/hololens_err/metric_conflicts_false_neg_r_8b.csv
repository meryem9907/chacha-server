The caption is: 'Figure 6: Learning curve of CNN+PROTO (left) v.s. OUR (right) on the Reuters dataset. We plot average 5-way 1-shot accuracy over 50 episodes sampled from seen classes (blue) and unseen classes (red). While OUR has weaker representational power, it generalizes better to unseen classes.'.
Question: What is the approximate maximum value of the red line in the right graph at task 2000?
[Visual cue] Pay attention to color, position, shape, size, height, or direction.
Use information from the caption when it directly supports your answer; otherwise, focus on data present in the visual itself.
Respond with a concise, one-word or very short phrase. No full sentences, no explanations.
If the response is numeric, use digits only and include any units or suffixes (e.g., %, kg, $).
If the answer cannot be inferred from the figure and caption, please reply with the sentence: 'It is not possible to answer this question based only on the provided data.'
<thinking> Reasoning (do NOT respond yet)
Step 1 Identify the figure type and its axes/legend.
Step 2 Locate the graphical elements relevant to the question.
Step 3 Extract the key-value information.
Step 4 Determine the required values or qualitative trends.
Step 5 Integrate insights from the caption when necessary.
Step 6 Ensure the answer is either Yes or No as required
Step 7 Produce the concise answer following the formatting rules above.
